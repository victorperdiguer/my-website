    review: "During our time together at Vonzu, we worked very closely. I must admit that I took an immediate liking to Víctor. His assertiveness and ease in understanding how the software worked caught my attention. By the second week, he was already assessing the product as if he had spent his entire life at Vonzu! He has taken on challenging projects and is continously and successfully pushing them forward. It's not easy to do that in our line of work, it takes intelligence and resilience. I'm sure our paths will cross again one day!"
